#the flexdashboard interaction and presentation are what's going to influence our grade the most!

#Include text block that explains the data and data source as well as what the dashboard can be used for and how to explore it. Dashboard should have at least 3 planes with output (figure or tables) and at least one should be interactive. We can include all this in a single HTML page 

#Part of the group should work on organizing the flexdashboard and the others should work on coding and creating graphs/figures.
