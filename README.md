Project Title: Examining Health and Nutrition in South America

Description / Purpose: This project analyzes health, nutrition, and 
socio-economic indicators across South American countries, including child and 
adult health outcomes, GDP, and measures of political stability. It visualizes 
and explores patterns and relationships among these factors to better understand 
how economic and political contexts influence population health.

The project exists to provide a comprehensive, data-driven perspective on the 
multiple determinants of health, enabling researchers, policymakers, and 
organizations to identify correlations and trends that may inform public health 
strategies.

By integrating nutrition, health, economic, and political data, the project 
addresses the problem of fragmented analysis, offering a holistic view that can 
highlight areas of vulnerability and support evidence-based interventions across 
multiple domains.
